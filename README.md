# Live or Die with Your Best Friend

_This game is designed for two players connected by an inelastic rope. Together, they must fight against enemies and avoid traps. Collaboration is essential as they work to survive._


## Storyline
In rural China, the ancient custom of "corpse driving" involves transporting the deceased back to their ancestral lands for burial, often involving the body being made to "walk" back home. Rooted in the belief that peace in the afterlife is found only in one's roots, this journey crosses mist-shrouded valleys and spirit-whispering mountains, symbolizing a bridge between worlds. After the war, this practice brings your fallen squad home, but you and your friend become separated from the group. Fortunately, you still have each other. A soul bond connects you; don't leave the other behind; if one perishes, both lose. Together, you must navigate and combat the wilderness's dangers together to reach your final resting place.
