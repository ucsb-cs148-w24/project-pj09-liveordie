----CODING WITH AI EXPERIMENTS-----

What AI I used: **Google Gemini**
What did I use it for: Learning how to write Scene Management Unit/Integration Tests for the Start Scene Panel
Reflections:
- Gemini came in handy when I just wanted to get started with learning about testing frameworks in Unity
- One downfall is that the AI tool sometimes mixed up regular SW unit testing using C# with Unity script tests
  - Also learned that Unity testing framework does not provide ability to create "Mock" dependencies, which make unit testing options for scripts much harder
- One upside is that the AI tool was able to guide me to the correct formatting for creating unity tests, assembly files for testing frameworks, as well as an introductory list of assertions and test statements I could use in my tests
- Steps to take to ensure correct output: I had to feed it my entire script so it could generate some test case ideas. I also had to tell it some compiling issues I ran into upon using some of their written test cases (it originally had a lot of bugs)
- Future use: I think it does great at creating test ideas, but not neccessarily the code itself. Still a useful tool nontheless

I used Gemini Advanced to generate a tile map. The results were some high-quality concept pictures, but that wasn't my goal. Most of the AI generation (DALLE, Midjourney, SD) on the market wouldn't work. They either missed certain keywords top-down/2d/pixel/tile-map, or got those right with an artistic style that would not fit.

I used Codeium for code completion instead of Github Copilot.
Reflections:
- The tool was mostly useful for writing code similar to already written code. If I was writing something new, it would often generate wrong code. The best way to use it I found was to write pseudocode first so it can understand what to implement.
- I also used it to explain a portion of code and it gave a decent description of the code's functionality, but I wouldn't use it for stuff I didn't already understand.
- I also generated some documentation, which it was very good at and I only had to make minor edits.
- The way it makes diffs for code it writes is nicer to visualise than copilot
- In general, it seems as good if not better than Github Copilot, and it's free so I will be using it from now on.

        - I used Adobe Firefly to generate different sprite concepts for enemies and other player visuals.
        - I think this tool could be useful for generating concepts as the AI cannot create images in the exact style that our game is using. There are minor errors in the images themselves as they do not adhere to a pixel-by-pixel philosophy. Therefore the AI will be useful for generating concepts but not actual game assets.
        - Adobe Firefly has a feature that allows the importation of an image to use as a basis for the newly generated images. I ran a few tests using the sprites we have already developed for our game, which generated art that was closer to style we want. However, the images still did not use the same pixel structure which is why it should be restricted to concept-only.
