## Action item

* a goal: 
    Our main goal for the next sprint is to improve our team communication with more thorough code review to ensure there are no merge conflicts.

* a change/experiment: 
    We will polish and debug UIs for the last week as well as complete the leveling/weapon system.

* a measurement: 
    User feedback.

## Retro Assessment

* We used the 4 L's process (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For) with a Google Jamboard. Each member was able to add sticky notes to each part of the board with their thoughts and then we discussed each component as a group.
* The retro went well. We were able to communicate all our ideas in a fun and digestible way.
* Make sure everyone's talking. Keep the discussion flowing by giving your ideas.
