## Action item

* a goal: 
    Our main goals for the next sprint is to improve our team communication with branch pushes and coding conventions. We want to communicate what components of the project we are working on and the way we are writing our code to ensure there are no merge conflicts.

* a change/experiment: 
    We are going to add more descriptions to our Pull Requests. We will add a video demo-ing our changes to the project and add a test to the code to demonstrate how it works to teammates attempting to make changes in the future.

* a measurement: 
    Descriptive pull requests in order to avoid merge conflicts. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the 4 L's process (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For) with a Google Jamboard. Each member was able to add sticky notes to each part of the board with their thoughts and then we discussed each component as a group.
* The retro went well. We were able to communicate all our ideas in a fun and digestible way.
* Make sure everyone's talking. Keep the discussion flowing by giving your ideas. 

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
        - We are going to make our pull requests more descriptive with videos demonstrating our changes in order to avoid the amount of merge conflicts we get and allow for easier merges. 
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
        - We did improve things, there was less discussion required in order to observe what each member's pull requests constituted and we had less merge conflicts over the course of the week.
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change? 
        - We are going to keep this change going forward. It requires slightly more effort from each team member when creating a pull request but will save us from the process of resolving more merge conflicts in the future.
