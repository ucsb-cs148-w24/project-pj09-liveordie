## Action item

* a goal: Having concise structured meetings where things are decided. Learn more Unity. 
* a change/experiment: If there is a agenda already provided by the teaching staff, follow it, otherwise the facilitator/scribe should have an agenda. More pair work/small group work. 
* a measurement: Reports on what ppl have learned during scrum meetings. Time the meetings for 5 minutes. Have ppl group up if they have any issues. Actually stand up for stand-up meetings.

## Retro Assessment

* We used start/stop/continue. Each member took 10 mins to put their thoughts in Slack. Then each member discussed their points and we had a larger discussion on action items
* It went well. We had lots of action items
* Make sure everyone's talking. Keep the discussion flowing by giving your ideas. 

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
