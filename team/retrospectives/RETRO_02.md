## Action item

* a goal: 
    Our main goals for the next sprint is to improve our team communication with branch pushes and coding conventions. We want to communicate what components of the project we are working on and the way we are writing our code to ensure there are no merge conflicts.

* a change/experiment: 
    We are going to add more descriptions to our Pull Requests. We will add a video demo-ing our changes to the project and add a test to the code to demonstrate how it works to teammates attempting to make changes in the future.

* a measurement: 
    How many merge conflicts we get in the next week. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the 4 L's process (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For) with a Google Jamboard. Each member was able to add sticky notes to each part of the board with their thoughts and then we discussed each component as a group.
* The retro went well. We were able to communicate all our ideas in a fun and digestible way.
* Make sure everyone's talking. Keep the discussion flowing by giving your ideas. 

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment

* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)

* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
