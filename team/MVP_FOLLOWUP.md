-----FEEDBACK-----
    PRAISE
        - I admire them cause this is the only game being done in this class. They are using unity and it is great
        - I like the idea of having the players be tied together and having to work together. 
        - This is a really cool idea, the story/setting sounds really interesting
        - The 2D style of the game is a really good choice, I like the art style.
        - The UI of the game is quit good, and the game seems fun to play. 
        - I like the game, as an MVP it looks like it works well. 
        - Absolutely fantastic. I'm just curious what the end goal is. Looking forward to see where it goes.
        - N/A tbh. Good app.

    QUESTIONS/SUGGESTIONS
        - Are you planning on adding difficulty level which messes with speed or number of the monsters?
        - More levels and a healthbar is a really good idea. Really solid implementation
        - I think for the future feature, there should be different chapters and the level of difficulty.
        - Adding some music can help to set the scene for the game!
        - Is there a score system? I wonder how different levels of the game would look
        - The addition of things like levels and/or a point system would be something that would be nice.
        - I think you could work on adding a multiplayer option where people from different devices can log in and play together but overall, I think the game is pretty solid.
        - You can add single-player feature. XD
        - I'd like to see more physics implemented with this project. 
        - Hopefully there is no annoying bugs which will make the game unplayable. Also a multiplayer mode would be very cool like someone mentioned in section
        - I liked the background information about the game. How would you initiate this in the game? Would they be given the information before they play the game?
        - Adding a tutorial for the players would be greatly appreciated. The setting and ideas behind the game are very interesting. Further integration of such elements would make the game more immersive.
        - Maybe add an option so that players can change their controls, like using different keys on the keyboard.
        - It would be cool if the players could use "super" moves to attack the "bad guys".
        - I suggest creating multiple players to play on one computer. It would be more enganging. 
        - I like the idea, maybe you can add either difficulty sliders or levels like you mentioned. Overall looks very good!
